Q: Were going to Egypt in the near future. Do we need a visa? How much do visas cost and where is the easiest place to get them?
</p>


 <p align = "center" style = "width:75%" >
A: Yes, you will need a visa. Depending on your nationality, costs and procedures can differ. If youre an American citizen, you can purchase your visa at the airport upon arrival at a cost of $15 (US) per person. However, different nationalities have different rules.
For detailed information on visas and fees, please check our visas and passports page. You may also contact the Egyptian Embassy or Egyptian Consulate nearest you. In the US, look for consulate locations here. For quick visas, look here.

Q: We will be taking a cruise of the Mediterranean. As one of the port of calls, we are stopping for the day in Alexandria, Egypt. We know we need to have a visa for Egypt, even for the day. Can we get the visa when we arrive in Alexandria--at the pier--or do we have to get it ahead of time at an Egyptian consulate in the US before we depart on the cruise?
</p>
 <p align = "center" style = "width:75%" >
A: You may get the visa at the port.
